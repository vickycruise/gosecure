No, the provided code snippet encrypts the contents of a file using the AES-256-CBC cipher. It does not specifically target any particular file format such as a Word document (".doc" file).

The file_get_contents() function reads the contents of the file specified by the $file variable, which could be any file, including a Word document. However, the encryption itself is not tailored to any specific file format. It simply operates on the binary data of the file.

If you want to encrypt a Word document, you would first need to read its contents using file_get_contents(), as demonstrated in the code snippet. Then you would apply the encryption process to the obtained content. After encryption, you can save the encrypted data to a file with an appropriate file extension (e.g., ".enc").

Keep in mind that if you encrypt a Word document using this method, you won't be able to open it directly in Microsoft Word without first decrypting it. Also, encrypting and decrypting Word documents using PHP may not preserve all formatting and metadata associated with the document.

If your goal is to encrypt Word documents while maintaining compatibility with Microsoft Word and preserving document integrity, you might want to explore libraries or tools specifically designed for handling Word documents and encryption, rather than using PHP's OpenSSL functions directly.
